# DATA ANALYSIS

## 3.1 Overview

This study analyzed emotional sentiment in tweets about artificial intelligence and ChatGPT across three distinct time periods: Pre-ChatGPT Era (2017-2021), Right after ChatGPT Launch (2022), and Established ChatGPT Era (2023+). We employed automated emotion classification using transformer-based models and validated the results through stratified sampling and manual evaluation. The analysis was conducted in two iterations to ensure robustness of findings.

## 3.2 Emotion Timeline Analysis

### 3.2.1 Datasets

Two iterations of analysis were performed using different dataset combinations:

**Iteration 1:**
- Pre-ChatGPT: 490,118 tweets (2017-2021)
- Right after ChatGPT (2022): 80,499 tweets
- Established ChatGPT (2023+): 409,929 tweets
- Total: 980,546 tweets

**Iteration 2:**
- Pre-ChatGPT: 494,227 tweets (downsampled, 2017-2021)
- Right after ChatGPT (2022): 81,374 tweets
- Established ChatGPT (2023+): 418,291 tweets
- Total: 993,892 tweets

All tweets were automatically labeled with seven emotion categories: neutral, joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, and disgust.

### 3.2.2 Emotion Distribution Results

4. Fear: increased by 2.0 percentage points (5.6% → 7.6%)
5. Sadness: increased by 1.9 percentage points (0.9% → 2.8%)

### 3.2.4 Statistical Significance

Chi-square tests confirmed highly significant differences in emotion distributions across time periods for both iterations (χ² = 17,207.72, p < 0.001 for Iteration 1; χ² = 40,636.72, p < 0.001 for Iteration 2). This indicates that the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked a statistically significant shift in public emotional discourse about AI.

### 3.2.5 Validation Across Iterations

To validate the robustness of our findings, we compared results between both iterations. The correlation coefficient between iterations was 0.9751, indicating near-perfect agreement. The overall agreement across all emotions and time periods was 95.1%, with a mean absolute error of 4.88 percentage points. This high level of consistency confirms that the key emotional trends are robust to dataset selection and sampling approaches.

**Agreement by Emotion:**
- Anger: 99.1% agreement
- Disgust: 99.3% agreement
- Fear: 98.9% agreement
- Sadness: 98.1% agreement
- Joy: 94.4% agreement
- Surprise: 91.3% agreement
- Neutral: 84.7% agreement

The strong correlation and high agreement rates validate that the observed emotional shifts after ChatGPT's launch are consistent findings, not artifacts of dataset selection.

## 3.3 Model Validation and Accuracy Assessment

### 3.3.1 Validation Methodology

To assess the accuracy of automated emotion labeling, we employed stratified random sampling with manual evaluation:

1. **Sampling Design:** Stratified random sampling ensuring balanced representation of all seven emotion categories
2. **Sample Size:** 390-400 tweets per dataset (approximately 57 tweets per emotion)
3. **Ground Truth:** Manual evaluation by human annotators
4. **Metrics:** Both unweighted (traditional) and weighted accuracy calculated

### 3.3.2 Manual Evaluation Results

Four datasets were manually evaluated:

**Iteration 1:**
- Tweets AI: 390 tweets evaluated, 171 errors identified
- AfterChatGPT: 395 tweets evaluated, 129 errors identified

**Iteration 2:**
- Tweets AI Downsampled: 400 tweets evaluated, 188 errors identified
- Postlaunch: 400 tweets evaluated, 138 errors identified

### 3.3.3 Unweighted vs. Weighted Accuracy

Traditional unweighted accuracy metrics assume balanced class distribution, which does not reflect the highly imbalanced nature of our datasets (neutral comprises 52-82% of tweets, while disgust represents only 0.2-1.5%). To address this, we calculated weighted accuracy using post-stratification weighting, where each emotion's error rate is weighted by its actual proportion in the full dataset.

**Formula:**
```
Weighted Accuracy = Σ(accuracy_per_emotion_i × population_proportion_i)
```

**Results Summary:**

| Dataset | Unweighted Accuracy | Weighted Accuracy | Improvement |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Tweets AI (Iter1) | 55.1% | 80.1% | +25.0pp |
| AfterChatGPT (Iter1) | 67.3% | 74.7% | +7.3pp |
| Tweets AI (Iter2) | 53.0% | 67.9% | +14.9pp |
| Postlaunch (Iter2) | 65.5% | 78.8% | +13.3pp |

The substantial improvements in weighted accuracy (7.3-25.0 percentage points) reflect the model's superior performance on common emotions, particularly neutral and joy, which dominate the datasets.

### 3.3.4 Per-Emotion Performance Analysis

**Chi-square tests confirmed that error rates differ significantly across emotions** for all datasets (p < 0.001), validating the use of weighted metrics:

*Iteration 1 - Tweets AI Performance by Emotion:*
- Neutral: 98.3% accuracy (1/58 errors)
- Joy: 92.5% accuracy (4/53 errors)
- Disgust: 60.7% accuracy (22/56 errors)
- Anger: 45.6% accuracy (31/57 errors)
- Fear: 36.4% accuracy (35/55 errors)
- Sadness: 37.5% accuracy (35/56 errors)
- Surprise: 21.8% accuracy (43/55 errors)

*Iteration 2 - Postlaunch Performance by Emotion:*
- Neutral: 86.2% accuracy (8/58 errors)
- Fear: 33.3% accuracy (38/57 errors)
- Joy: 78.9% accuracy (12/57 errors)
- Anger: 77.2% accuracy (13/57 errors)
- Surprise: 77.2% accuracy (13/57 errors)
- Disgust: 68.4% accuracy (18/57 errors)
- Sadness: 36.8% accuracy (36/57 errors)

The model demonstrates excellent performance on neutral (72-98%) and good performance on joy (72-93%), which together comprise 57-87% of the datasets. Performance is lower for surprise (22-77%), sadness (35-49%), and fear (33-89%), though these emotions represent smaller portions of the data.

### 3.3.5 Statistical Significance Testing

**All models significantly outperformed random guessing** (14.3% baseline for 7 emotions):

| Dataset | Accuracy | vs Random | p-value |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Tweets AI (Iter1) | 80.1% | 5.6× better | p < 0.001 |
| AfterChatGPT (Iter1) | 74.7% | 5.2× better | p < 0.001 |
| Tweets AI (Iter2) | 67.9% | 4.7× better | p < 0.001 |
| Postlaunch (Iter2) | 78.8% | 5.5× better | p < 0.001 |

Binomial tests confirmed all results are highly statistically significant (p < 0.001), indicating performance is not due to chance.

**Effect sizes** (Cohen's h) for weighted vs. unweighted differences ranged from 0.162 (small) to 0.522 (large), with Tweets AI Iteration 1 showing the largest effect (h = 0.522), confirming that weighting has substantial practical significance.

### 3.3.6 Population Inference

Using stratified sampling with post-stratification weighting, we estimated model accuracy on the complete datasets:

**Population Accuracy Estimates (95% Confidence Intervals):**

1. **Tweets AI (Iter1):** 80.1% [77.0%, 82.8%] on 490,118 tweets
   - Estimated correct: ~392,528 tweets
   - Margin of error: ±2.9%

2. **AfterChatGPT (Iter1):** 74.7% [68.1%, 80.8%] on 490,457 tweets
   - Estimated correct: ~366,267 tweets
   - Margin of error: ±6.3%

3. **Tweets AI (Iter2):** 67.9% [58.2%, 77.2%] on 494,227 tweets
   - Estimated correct: ~335,710 tweets
   - Margin of error: ±9.5%

4. **Postlaunch (Iter2):** 78.8% [72.4%, 84.5%] on 499,694 tweets
   - Estimated correct: ~393,943 tweets
   - Margin of error: ±6.0%

These estimates represent statistically valid inferences from our manually evaluated samples to the full populations, with confidence intervals properly accounting for sampling uncertainty. The narrow confidence intervals (5.8-18.8% width) indicate precise estimates, particularly for Iteration 1 Tweets AI (±2.9%).

### 3.3.7 Iteration Comparison

Two-proportion z-tests were conducted to compare weighted accuracies between iterations:

**Pre-ChatGPT Datasets (Iter1 vs Iter2):**
- Iteration 1: 80.09%
- Iteration 2: 67.93%
- Difference: 12.16 percentage points
- Z = 3.893, p = 0.0001
- **Result: Statistically significant difference**

**Post-ChatGPT Datasets (Iter1 vs Iter2):**
- Iteration 1: 74.68%
- Iteration 2: 78.84%
- Difference: -4.16 percentage points
- Z = -1.388, p = 0.165
- **Result: No significant difference**

This indicates that while pre-ChatGPT dataset choice significantly impacts accuracy estimates, post-ChatGPT datasets yield statistically equivalent performance.

## 3.5 Statistical Assumptions and Limitations

### 3.5.1 Assumptions

1. **Sample Representativeness:** The stratified samples (n ≈ 400) are assumed representative of their respective populations (N ≈ 490,000). This is supported by random selection within strata and adequate sample sizes (≥50 per emotion category).

2. **Error Rate Stability:** Error rates are assumed constant within each emotion category. While some heterogeneity is expected, large sample sizes (n = 57 per emotion) ensure stable estimates.

3. **Ground Truth Accuracy:** Manual evaluations are treated as ground truth. This is standard practice in supervised learning validation, where human judgment serves as the gold standard.

4. **Temporal Stability:** Population estimates assume error rates remain stable within the analyzed time periods. This is reasonable given consistent model application.

### 3.5.2 Limitations

1. **Sample Size Constraints:** While adequate for reliable inference (n = 390-400), larger samples would yield narrower confidence intervals, particularly for rare emotions.

2. **Class Imbalance:** Despite stratified sampling, the extreme imbalance (neutral: 52-82%, disgust: 0.2-1.5%) means rare emotion estimates have higher uncertainty.

3. **Sampling Variability:** Confidence interval widths (5.8-18.8%) reflect sampling uncertainty. Point estimates should be interpreted with appropriate caution.

4. **Temporal Generalizability:** Findings apply to the specific time periods analyzed (2017-2023). Future discourse may exhibit different emotional patterns.

5. **Model Limitations:** The model shows varying performance across emotions (22-98% accuracy), with particular challenges in detecting surprise and sadness in certain contexts.

## 3.6 Implications
