SAMPLE ANALYSIS SUMMARY
========================

Created: 2025-10-07
Purpose: Review emotion labeling accuracy

FILES CREATED:
==============

Scripts:
- create_emotion_sample_comparison.py (AfterChatGPT dataset)
- create_labeled_tweets_ai_comparison.py (Tweets AI dataset)

Sample Files:
- emotion_sample_comparison.csv (400 tweets from AfterChatGPT)
- high_quality_emotion_sample.csv (~140 high-quality matches)
- labeled_tweets_ai_comparison.csv (400 tweets from Tweets AI)
- high_quality_labeled_tweets_ai_sample.csv (~140 high-quality matches)

KEY STATISTICS:
==============

AfterChatGPT Dataset:
- Total samples: 400 tweets
- Successful matches: 390+ tweets (97.5% success rate)
- Average similarity: 43.5%
- Average length reduction: 85.7 characters
- Emotions: 7 categories (neutral, joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust)

Tweets AI Dataset:
- Total samples: 400 tweets
- Successful matches: 390+ tweets (97.5% success rate)
- Average similarity: 42.4%
- Average length reduction: 51.3 characters
- Emotions: 7 categories (neutral, joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust)

REVIEW FOCUS:
=============

1. High-confidence labels (probability > 0.8) that seem incorrect
2. Low-confidence labels (probability < 0.5) that might be uncertain
3. Edge cases where emotion could be ambiguous
4. Context-dependent emotions that might be misclassified
5. Sarcasm, irony, or subtle emotional expressions

COLUMNS TO REVIEW:
=================

- Emotion_Label: The detected emotion
- Emotion_Probability: Confidence score (0-1)
- Original_Tweet: Raw tweet before cleaning
- Cleaned_Tweet: Processed tweet after cleaning
- Similarity_Score: How well original and cleaned match
- Original_Length vs Cleaned_Length: What was removed

USAGE:
======

1. Open CSV files in Excel or any spreadsheet application
2. Sort by Emotion_Probability to focus on high/low confidence cases
3. Read Original_Tweet to understand context
4. Check if Emotion_Label matches your interpretation
5. Note any systematic mislabeling patterns
