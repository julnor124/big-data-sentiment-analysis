EMOTION LABELING QUALITY REPORT
==============================

This report helps you evaluate the quality of emotion labeling
in your dataset. Use these metrics to assess reliability:

1. HIGH CONFIDENCE LABELS (>0.8): Most reliable
2. MEDIUM CONFIDENCE LABELS (0.5-0.8): Generally reliable  
3. LOW CONFIDENCE LABELS (<0.5): May need review

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Focus on high-confidence labels for analysis
- Review low-confidence labels manually
- Consider re-labeling if quality score < 60
- Use similarity scores to validate matches
