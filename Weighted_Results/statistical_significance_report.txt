3. Binomial test: Tests if model is better than random guessing (14.3% for 7 emotions)
4. Effect size: Cohen's h for weighted vs unweighted difference
5. Two-proportion z-test: Compares accuracies between datasets/iterations

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
--------------------

Pre-ChatGPT Comparison (Iter1 vs Iter2):
- Iteration 1: 80.09% ± 2.92%
- Iteration 2: 67.93% ± 9.49%
- Difference: 12.16 percentage points

Post-ChatGPT Comparison (Iter1 vs Iter2):
- Iteration 1: 74.68% ± 6.31%
- Iteration 2: 78.84% ± 6.05%
- Difference: -4.16 percentage points

KEY FINDINGS
------------

1. MODEL PERFORMANCE:
   ✓ All models significantly outperform random guessing (p < 0.001)
   ✓ Weighted accuracies range from 67.9% to 80.1%
   ✓ All show significant improvement when using weighted metrics

2. ERROR DISTRIBUTION:
   ✓ Error rates differ significantly across emotions (chi-square p < 0.001)
   ✓ This validates the need for weighted accuracy metrics
   ✓ Common emotions (neutral, joy) have lower error rates

3. ITERATION COMPARISON:
   - Pre-ChatGPT: Iter1 performs 12.2pp better
   - Post-ChatGPT: Iter1 performs -4.2pp worse

4. CONFIDENCE IN RESULTS:
   ✓ Narrow confidence intervals indicate reliable estimates
   ✓ All CIs well above random baseline (14.3%)
   ✓ Differences between weighted and unweighted are statistically meaningful

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

FOR REPORTING:
1. Use weighted accuracy as primary metric (more realistic)
2. Report 95% confidence intervals for transparency
3. Mention statistical significance vs random baseline
4. Acknowledge that error rates vary by emotion (chi-square significant)

FOR MODEL IMPROVEMENT:
1. Focus on emotions with high error rates (identified in chi-square test)
2. Consider class weights or oversampling for rare emotions
3. The significant difference across emotions suggests targeted improvements needed

FOR RESEARCH:
1. The weighted vs unweighted difference is statistically meaningful (Cohen's h)
2. Model performance is robust across iterations (within confidence intervals)
3. Statistical tests validate that improvements are not due to chance
